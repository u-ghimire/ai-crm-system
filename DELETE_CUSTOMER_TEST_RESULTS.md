# Delete Customer Functionality - Test Results

## Issue Reported
User reported: "Delete customer is not working"

## Investigation Results

### Code Review
The delete customer functionality has been properly implemented:

**Backend (app.py, lines 167-171):**
```python
elif request.method == 'DELETE':
    success = db.delete_customer(customer_id)
    if success:
        return jsonify({'success': True})
    return jsonify({'error': 'Delete failed'}), 400
```

**Database Layer (modules/database.py, lines 236-252):**
```python
def delete_customer(self, customer_id: int):
    """Delete customer"""
    conn = self.get_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Delete related records first (cascade delete)
    cursor.execute('DELETE FROM interactions WHERE customer_id = ?', (customer_id,))
    cursor.execute('DELETE FROM opportunities WHERE customer_id = ?', (customer_id,))
    cursor.execute('DELETE FROM tasks WHERE customer_id = ?', (customer_id,))
    cursor.execute('DELETE FROM ai_insights WHERE customer_id = ?', (customer_id,))
    
    # Delete customer
    cursor.execute('DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = ?', (customer_id,))
    
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return True  # ✅ Returns True on success
```

**Frontend (CustomerDetail.jsx, lines 32-43):**
```javascript
const handleDelete = async () => {
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this customer?')) {
    try {
      await customersAPI.delete(customer.id)
      toast.success('Customer deleted successfully')
      onRefresh()
      onClose()
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error('Failed to delete customer')
    }
  }
}
```

### Test Results ✅

**Test 1: Delete Mike Chen**
- **Action**: Clicked "Delete Customer" button in CustomerDetail modal
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
  - Confirmation dialog appeared
  - After confirmation, customer was deleted
  - Success toast: "Customer deleted successfully"
  - Modal closed automatically
  - Customer list refreshed
  - Mike Chen removed from the table
  - Backend log: `DELETE /api/customers/4 HTTP/1.1" 200`

**Test 2: Delete John Smith**
- **Action**: Clicked "Delete Customer" button for second customer
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
  - Confirmation dialog appeared
  - Customer deleted successfully
  - Success message displayed
  - Customer list updated
  - Only 1 customer (Sarah Johnson) remains

### Backend Logs Confirmation
```
127.0.0.1 - - [06/Oct/2025 22:18:28] "DELETE /api/customers/4 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [06/Oct/2025 22:18:28] "GET /api/customers HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Both DELETE and subsequent GET requests returned status 200 (success).

## Conclusion

**The delete customer functionality IS working correctly!**

### Features Working:
1. ✅ Delete button in CustomerDetail modal
2. ✅ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
3. ✅ Backend properly deletes customer and related records (cascade delete)
4. ✅ Success toast notification displayed
5. ✅ Modal closes after deletion
6. ✅ Customer list automatically refreshes
7. ✅ Deleted customer removed from UI
8. ✅ Database updated correctly

### Possible User Issues:
If the user experienced issues, it may have been:
1. Cached browser data - resolved by hard refresh
2. Backend not running - resolved by starting server
3. Previous version of code before our fixes - resolved by using latest code
4. Database connection issues - resolved by server restart

All tests confirm the delete functionality works as expected with no errors.
